# gititag

With `gititag` you can handle your repository semver tags interactively. Just run `npx gititag` and follow the instructions.

`gititag` will detect any previously existing tags and allow you to choose if you want to bump the version by `patch`, `minor`, or `major` all with your keyboard. After tagging, it will ask you if you want to push the tag to the remote `origin`. Don't worry! You won't be able to do this by accident.

## Getting started

To get started simply run

```
npx gititag
```

and follow the instructions! It's as easy as that!
